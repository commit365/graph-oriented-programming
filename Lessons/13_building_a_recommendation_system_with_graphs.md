# Lesson 13: Building a Recommendation System with Graphs

Welcome back, recommendation wizards! In this lesson, we’re going to embark on an exciting journey to build a **recommendation system** using the power of graphs. Just as a skilled chef combines ingredients to create a delicious dish, you will learn how to combine user-item interactions to serve up personalized recommendations. By the end of this lesson, you’ll be equipped to model interactions and implement collaborative filtering techniques using graphs. Let’s dive in!

## What is a Recommendation System?

A **recommendation system** is a tool that suggests products, services, or content to users based on their preferences and behaviors. These systems are widely used in various domains, including e-commerce, streaming services, and social media platforms. The goal is to enhance user experience by providing personalized suggestions that align with individual tastes.

### Why Use Graphs for Recommendation Systems?

Graphs are particularly well-suited for recommendation systems because they naturally represent relationships between users and items. By modeling these interactions as a graph, we can leverage graph algorithms to uncover patterns and make informed recommendations. Here are a few reasons why graphs are effective:

- **Rich Relationships**: Graphs can capture complex relationships, such as user preferences, item similarities, and social connections.
- **Dynamic Structure**: Graphs can easily adapt to changes, such as new users or items, without requiring extensive restructuring.
- **Efficient Traversal**: Graph algorithms can efficiently explore connections and identify relevant recommendations.

## 1. Modeling User-Item Interactions

To build a recommendation system, we first need to model the interactions between users and items in a graph. This involves defining the nodes and edges that represent users, items, and their relationships.

### Defining Nodes

In our recommendation system, we will have two types of nodes:

- **User Nodes**: Represent individual users in the system.
- **Item Nodes**: Represent the items (products, movies, etc.) that users can interact with.

### Defining Edges

Edges will represent the interactions between users and items. For example, we can define edges based on the following interactions:

- **Likes**: A user likes an item.
- **Purchases**: A user purchases an item.
- **Rates**: A user rates an item (e.g., gives a score from 1 to 5).

### Example Graph Structure

Let’s visualize a simple graph representing user-item interactions:

```
   (User1) --[LIKES]--> (ItemA)
      |                  |
      |                  |
   [PURCHASES]      [RATES]
      |                  |
   (User2) --[LIKES]--> (ItemB)
```

In this graph:
- **User1** likes **ItemA** and purchases **ItemB**.
- **User2** likes **ItemB** and rates **ItemA**.

## 2. Implementing Collaborative Filtering Using Graph Techniques

**Collaborative filtering** is a popular technique used in recommendation systems to make predictions based on the preferences of similar users. There are two main types of collaborative filtering:

1. **User-Based Collaborative Filtering**: Recommendations are made based on the preferences of users who are similar to the target user.
2. **Item-Based Collaborative Filtering**: Recommendations are made based on the similarity between items that the target user has interacted with.

### User-Based Collaborative Filtering

In user-based collaborative filtering, we identify users who have similar preferences and recommend items that those similar users have liked or interacted with. Here’s how to implement it using graph techniques:

1. **Identify Similar Users**:
   - Use graph traversal algorithms (like BFS or DFS) to find users who have interacted with the same items.
   - Calculate similarity scores based on shared interactions.

2. **Generate Recommendations**:
   - For each similar user, collect the items they liked or interacted with.
   - Filter out items the target user has already interacted with.
   - Rank the remaining items based on the number of similar users who liked them.

### Item-Based Collaborative Filtering

In item-based collaborative filtering, we focus on the relationships between items. Here’s how to implement it:

1. **Identify Similar Items**:
   - Use graph algorithms to analyze the relationships between items based on user interactions.
   - Calculate similarity scores between items based on shared users.

2. **Generate Recommendations**:
   - For each item the target user has interacted with, find similar items based on the calculated similarity scores.
   - Recommend the top-ranked similar items that the user has not yet interacted with.

### Example Implementation

Let’s implement a simple user-based collaborative filtering algorithm using Python and a graph representation. We’ll use an adjacency list to represent the user-item interactions.

```python
from collections import defaultdict

# Sample user-item interaction graph
graph = defaultdict(set)

# Adding interactions
graph['User1'].update(['ItemA', 'ItemB'])
graph['User2'].update(['ItemB', 'ItemC'])
graph['User3'].update(['ItemA', 'ItemC'])
graph['User4'].update(['ItemA'])

def get_similar_users(graph, target_user):
    similar_users = defaultdict(int)
    
    # Find items liked by the target user
    target_items = graph[target_user]
    
    # Compare with other users
    for user, items in graph.items():
        if user != target_user:
            # Count shared items
            shared_items = target_items.intersection(items)
            if shared_items:
                similar_users[user] = len(shared_items)
    
    # Sort users by similarity score
    return sorted(similar_users.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)

# Example usage
target_user = 'User1'
similar_users = get_similar_users(graph, target_user)
print(f"Users similar to {target_user}: {similar_users}")
```

## Applications of Recommendation Systems in Real-World Scenarios

Recommendation systems powered by graph techniques have numerous applications across various domains. Here are some exciting real-world scenarios:

### 1. E-Commerce

- **Product Recommendations**: Online retailers use recommendation systems to suggest products to customers based on their browsing and purchasing history, enhancing the shopping experience and increasing sales.

### 2. Streaming Services

- **Content Recommendations**: Streaming platforms like Netflix and Spotify use recommendation systems to suggest movies, shows, or music based on users’ viewing or listening habits, keeping users engaged.

### 3. Social Media

- **Friend Suggestions**: Social media platforms use recommendation systems to suggest friends or connections based on mutual friends and shared interests, fostering community engagement.

### 4. News and Content Aggregation

- **Personalized News Feeds**: News platforms use recommendation systems to curate personalized news feeds for users based on their reading habits and preferences, ensuring they receive relevant content.

### 5. Online Learning Platforms

- **Course Recommendations**: Educational platforms use recommendation systems to suggest courses to learners based on their previous courses and interests, enhancing the learning experience.

## Fun Activity: Build Your Own Recommendation System!

Now it’s your turn to put your knowledge into action! Follow these steps:

1. **Create a User-Item Interaction Graph**: Use the following adjacency list to create a graph representing user-item interactions:

```python
graph = {
    'User1': {'ItemA', 'ItemB'},
    'User2': {'ItemB', 'ItemC'},
    'User3': {'ItemA', 'ItemC'},
    'User4': {'ItemA'},
    'ItemA': set(),
    'ItemB': set(),
    'ItemC': set()
}
```

2. **Implement Collaborative Filtering**: Write your own implementation of user-based collaborative filtering. Use print statements to show the similar users and recommended items for a target user.

3. **Experiment**: Modify the graph structure by adding or removing users and items. Observe how the recommendations change based on the graph structure!
