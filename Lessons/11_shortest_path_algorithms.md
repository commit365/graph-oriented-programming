# Lesson 11: Shortest Path Algorithms

Welcome back, intrepid graph explorers! In this lesson, we’re going to navigate the thrilling terrain of **shortest path algorithms**. Whether you’re finding the quickest route on a map or optimizing network traffic, understanding how to determine the shortest path in a graph is a crucial skill. We’ll dive into **Dijkstra’s algorithm** and the **A\* search algorithm**, exploring their mechanics, applications, and the magic of heuristics. Let’s get started on this exciting journey!

## What Are Shortest Path Algorithms?

Shortest path algorithms are techniques used to find the most efficient route between two nodes in a graph. These algorithms consider various factors, such as edge weights (distances, costs, or times), to determine the optimal path. They are essential in various applications, including navigation systems, network routing, and game development.

## 1. Dijkstra’s Algorithm

### What is Dijkstra’s Algorithm?

**Dijkstra’s algorithm** is a popular algorithm used to find the shortest path from a starting node to all other nodes in a weighted graph. It works by systematically exploring the graph and updating the shortest known distance to each node until the shortest paths are determined.

### How Dijkstra’s Algorithm Works

1. **Initialization**: 
   - Set the distance to the starting node to 0 and all other nodes to infinity.
   - Mark all nodes as unvisited.
   - Set the starting node as the current node.

2. **Visit Neighbors**: 
   - For the current node, consider all its unvisited neighbors and calculate their tentative distances.
   - If the calculated distance to a neighbor is less than the previously recorded distance, update it.

3. **Mark as Visited**: 
   - Once all neighbors have been considered, mark the current node as visited. A visited node will not be checked again.

4. **Select Next Node**: 
   - Select the unvisited node with the smallest tentative distance and set it as the new current node.

5. **Repeat**: 
   - Repeat the process until all nodes have been visited or the shortest path to the target node has been found.

### Dijkstra’s Algorithm Example

Let’s consider the following graph:

```
     (A)
    / | \
   1  4  2
  /   |   \
(B)---3----(C)
 |         /
 2       1
 |       /
(D)-----/
   1
```

To find the shortest path from A to D using Dijkstra’s algorithm:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - Distances: A=0, B=∞, C=∞, D=∞
   - Current node: A

2. **Visit Neighbors**:
   - From A to B: Distance = 1 (update B)
   - From A to C: Distance = 2 (update C)
   - From A to D: Distance = 4 (update D)

3. **Mark A as Visited**: 
   - Distances: A=0, B=1, C=2, D=4
   - Current node: B (smallest distance)

4. **Visit Neighbors of B**:
   - From B to D: Distance = 1 + 2 = 3 (update D)

5. **Mark B as Visited**: 
   - Distances: A=0, B=1, C=2, D=3
   - Current node: C (next smallest distance)

6. **Visit Neighbors of C**: 
   - No updates needed.

7. **Mark C as Visited**: 
   - Current node: D (final node).

The shortest path from A to D is A -> B -> D with a total distance of 3.

### Dijkstra’s Algorithm Implementation

Here’s a simple implementation of Dijkstra’s algorithm in Python:

```python
import heapq

def dijkstra(graph, start):
    # Priority queue to hold the nodes to visit
    queue = []
    heapq.heappush(queue, (0, start))  # (distance, node)
    
    # Distances dictionary
    distances = {node: float('infinity') for node in graph}
    distances[start] = 0

    while queue:
        current_distance, current_node = heapq.heappop(queue)

        # Nodes can only be visited once
        if current_distance > distances[current_node]:
            continue

        for neighbor, weight in graph[current_node].items():
            distance = current_distance + weight

            # Only consider this new path if it's better
            if distance < distances[neighbor]:
                distances[neighbor] = distance
                heapq.heappush(queue, (distance, neighbor))

    return distances

# Example usage
graph = {
    'A': {'B': 1, 'C': 4, 'D': 2},
    'B': {'D': 2},
    'C': {'D': 1},
    'D': {}
}
print(dijkstra(graph, 'A'))
```

## 2. A* Search Algorithm

### What is the A* Search Algorithm?

The **A* search algorithm** is an extension of Dijkstra’s algorithm that incorporates heuristics to improve performance. It finds the shortest path from a starting node to a target node by considering both the cost to reach a node and an estimated cost to reach the target.

### How A* Works

1. **Initialization**:
   - Set the starting node's cost to 0 and all other nodes to infinity.
   - Maintain a priority queue to explore nodes based on their total estimated cost (f(n) = g(n) + h(n)), where:
     - g(n) = cost from the start node to node n.
     - h(n) = estimated cost from node n to the target (heuristic).

2. **Visit Neighbors**:
   - For the current node, calculate the cost for each neighbor.
   - If the calculated cost is lower than the previously recorded cost, update it.

3. **Select Next Node**:
   - Choose the unvisited node with the lowest total estimated cost (f(n)) and set it as the current node.

4. **Repeat**:
   - Continue until the target node is reached or all nodes have been visited.

### A* Example

Using the same graph as before, let’s say we want to find the shortest path from A to D, with the following heuristic values (straight-line distance to D):

- h(B) = 2
- h(C) = 1
- h(D) = 0

1. **Initialization**: 
   - Start with A: g(A)=0, f(A)=0+h(A)=0+2=2.

2. **Visit Neighbors**:
   - From A to B: g(B)=1, f(B)=1+h(B)=1+2=3.
   - From A to C: g(C)=4, f(C)=4+h(C)=4+1=5.
   - From A to D: g(D)=2, f(D)=2+h(D)=2+0=2.

3. **Select Next Node**: 
   - Visit D (lowest f value).

The shortest path from A to D is A -> D with a total distance of 2.

### A* Implementation

Here’s a simple implementation of the A* algorithm in Python:

```python
import heapq

def a_star(graph, start, goal, heuristics):
    open_set = []
    heapq.heappush(open_set, (0, start))  # (f_score, node)

    g_scores = {node: float('infinity') for node in graph}
    g_scores[start] = 0

    while open_set:
        current_f, current_node = heapq.heappop(open_set)

        if current_node == goal:
            return g_scores[goal]

        for neighbor, weight in graph[current_node].items():
            tentative_g = g_scores[current_node] + weight

            if tentative_g < g_scores[neighbor]:
                g_scores[neighbor] = tentative_g
                f_score = tentative_g + heuristics[neighbor]
                heapq.heappush(open_set, (f_score, neighbor))

    return float('infinity')

# Example usage
graph = {
    'A': {'B': 1, 'C': 4, 'D': 2},
    'B': {'D': 2},
    'C': {'D': 1},
    'D': {}
}
heuristics = {'A': 2, 'B': 2, 'C': 1, 'D': 0}
print(a_star(graph, 'A', 'D', heuristics))
```
