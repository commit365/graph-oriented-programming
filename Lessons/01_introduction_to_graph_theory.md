# Lesson 1: Introduction to Graph Theory

Welcome to the fascinating world of graph theory! In this lesson, we will embark on an adventure through the fundamental concepts of graphs, exploring their definitions, types, and applications. By the end of this lesson, you will not only understand the basic terminology but also appreciate the beauty and utility of graphs in solving real-world problems.

## What is a Graph?

At its core, a graph is a collection of **nodes** (also called vertices) connected by **edges**. Think of a graph as a map of relationships, where each node represents an entity, and each edge represents a connection between those entities. 

### Definitions and Terminology

- **Node (Vertex)**: A fundamental unit of a graph that represents an entity. For example, in a social network graph, each person is a node.

- **Edge**: A connection between two nodes. Edges can represent various types of relationships, such as friendships, communications, or transactions.

- **Directed Graph**: In a directed graph, edges have a direction, meaning they go from one node to another. This is like a one-way street where you can only travel in one direction. For example, if node A points to node B, you can travel from A to B, but not from B to A.

- **Directed Graph Example: Social Network**
   - **Vertices (Nodes):**
   - User A
   - User B
   - User C

   - **Edges (Directed Relationships):**
   - A → B (User A follows User B)
   - B → C (User B follows User C)
   - C → A (User C follows User A)
   - A → C (User A follows User C)

   - **Visualization**

      ```
          A
         / \
        v   v
        B → C
      ```

   - **Explanation**
   In this directed graph:
   - Each user is represented as a node.
   - The arrows (directed edges) indicate the direction of the relationship (who follows whom).
   - This example effectively demonstrates the concept of directed graphs, where the edges have a specific direction, highlighting the one-way nature of the relationships.



- **Undirected Graph**: In an undirected graph, edges have no direction. This means you can travel in both directions between nodes, just like a two-way street. For example, if there is an edge between nodes A and B, you can go from A to B and from B to A.
  
   - **Undirected Graph Example: Social Network**
      - **Vertices (Nodes):**
      - User A
      - User B
      - User C

      - **Edges (Undirected Relationships):**
      - A -- B (User A is friends with User B)
      - A -- C (User A is friends with User C)
      - B -- C (User B is friends with User C)

   - **Visualization**

      ```
        A
       / \
      B---C
      ```

   - **Explanation**
   In this undirected graph:
   - Each user is represented as a node.
   - The lines (undirected edges) indicate the mutual friendships between users, meaning if User A is friends with User B, then User B is also friends with User A.
   - This example effectively demonstrates the concept of undirected graphs, where the edges do not have a direction, highlighting the reciprocal nature of the relationships.


### Types of Graphs

Graphs come in various shapes and sizes, each suited for different applications. Let’s explore some of the most common types:

1. **Weighted Graph**: In a weighted graph, each edge has a numerical value (or weight) associated with it. This weight can represent distance, cost, or any other metric. For example, in a road network graph, the weight might represent the distance between two cities.

   - **Weighted Graph Example: Transportation Network**

      - **Vertices (Nodes):**
      - A (City A)
      - B (City B)
      - C (City C)
      - D (City D)

      - **Edges (Weighted Relationships):**
      - A -- B (weight: 5)  (Distance from City A to City B is 5 miles)
      - A -- C (weight: 10) (Distance from City A to City C is 10 miles)
      - B -- C (weight: 2)  (Distance from City B to City C is 2 miles)
      - B -- D (weight: 4)  (Distance from City B to City D is 4 miles)
      - C -- D (weight: 1)  (Distance from City C to City D is 1 mile)

      - **Visualization**

         ```
            5
         A -------- B
         | \       | \
         |  \      |  \
         10   2    4   |
         |     \    |   |
         |      \   |   |
         C -------- D
               1
         ```

      - **Explanation**
      In this weighted graph:
      - Each city is represented as a node (vertex).
      - The edges between the nodes represent the roads connecting the cities, with weights indicating the distance (or travel time) associated with each road.
      - This example effectively demonstrates the concept of weighted graphs, where the edges have associated weights that provide additional information about the relationships between the nodes.


2. **Unweighted Graph**: In an unweighted graph, edges do not have weights. All edges are treated equally, which simplifies many algorithms. For example, in a social network graph, you might simply want to know if two users are connected, regardless of the strength of their relationship.

3. **Cyclic Graph**: A cyclic graph contains at least one cycle, which is a path that starts and ends at the same node. Cycles can represent feedback loops in systems, such as in a network of dependencies.

   - **Cyclic Graph Example: Circular Pathway**

      **Vertices (Nodes):**
      - A (Location A)
      - B (Location B)
      - C (Location C)
      - D (Location D)

      **Edges (Relationships):**
      - A -- B (Path from Location A to Location B)
      - B -- C (Path from Location B to Location C)
      - C -- D (Path from Location C to Location D)
      - D -- A (Path from Location D back to Location A)

      - **Visualization**

         ```
             A
            / \
           D---B
            \ /
             C
         ```

      - **Explanation**
      In this cyclic graph:
      - Each location is represented as a node.
      - The edges connect the nodes in a circular manner, allowing for a continuous path that starts and ends at the same node (e.g., starting at A, moving to B, C, D, and returning to A).
      - This example effectively demonstrates the concept of cyclic graphs, where there is at least one cycle present, allowing traversal through the graph in a loop.


4. **Acyclic Graph**: An acyclic graph does not contain any cycles. A common example of an acyclic graph is a **tree**, which is a special type of graph used to represent hierarchical structures, such as family trees or organizational charts.

   - **Acyclic Graph Example: Tree Structure**

      **Vertices (Nodes):**
      - A (Root)
      - B (Child of A)
      - C (Child of A)
      - D (Child of B)
      - E (Child of B)

      **Edges (Relationships):**
      - A -- B (A is the parent of B)
      - A -- C (A is the parent of C)
      - B -- D (B is the parent of D)
      - B -- E (B is the parent of E)

      - **Visualization**

         ```
               A
              / \
             B   C
            / \
           D   E
         ```

      - **Explanation**
      In this acyclic graph:
      - Each node represents an entity (e.g., a person, object, or concept).
      - The edges represent parent-child relationships, showing the hierarchy.
      - There are no cycles present, as it is impossible to return to the root node (A) by traversing the edges.

### Real-World Applications of Graphs

Graphs are not just theoretical constructs; they are everywhere in the real world! Here are some exciting applications of graph theory:

- **Social Networks**: Graphs model relationships between users, allowing us to analyze connections, find influencers, and recommend friends.

- **Transportation Networks**: Graphs represent routes and connections in transportation systems, helping to optimize travel routes and reduce congestion.

- **Recommendation Systems**: Graphs help in recommending products or content based on user preferences and interactions.

- **Biological Networks**: In biology, graphs can model interactions between proteins, genes, and other biological entities, aiding in the understanding of complex systems.

### Fun Activity: Create Your Own Graph!

Now that you have a basic understanding of graph theory, let’s put your knowledge to the test! Grab a piece of paper and draw your own graph representing your social network. 

1. **Nodes**: Represent yourself and your friends as nodes.
2. **Edges**: Draw edges to represent friendships. Use directed edges if you want to show who follows whom on social media.
3. **Weights**: If you want to get fancy, assign weights to your edges based on how close you feel to each friend (e.g., 1 for acquaintances, 5 for best friends).
